Hello all, here is the details of the Task
Web Scraping Task – E-Commerce Product Data Collection
Objective
Your task is to build a Python-based web scraper using BeautifulSoup that collects structured product data from an e-commerce website of your choice (e.g., Jumia, Amazon, Newegg, etc.). The final goal is to compile the extracted data into a clean CSV file or Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

Requirements
Your scraper should extract the following details for at least 100 products in a specific category (e.g., laptops, shoes, books):

Product Name / Title

Price

Product Rating (if available)

Number of Reviews (if available)

Product URL

Image URL

Brand (if available)

Tips and Guidelines
Use the browser's developer tools (Inspect Element) to examine the HTML structure of the page.

Right-click an item (e.g., product name or price) → “Inspect” to find its tag, class, or ID.

Use Ctrl+F inside the HTML inspector to search for repeated tags (like <div class="product-name">).

Identify patterns in the HTML that can help you loop through product cards.

Start with one page. Once it works, implement logic to navigate through multiple pages if the site uses pagination (e.g., “Next” button or page numbers).

Use headers in your requests to mimic a browser (to avoid bot detection).

Respect the website's robots.txt policy. You can check it by visiting www.website.com/robots.txt.

If the site loads content with JavaScript (content not visible in page source), BeautifulSoup might not work well — skip such sites for now or switch to a simpler one.
