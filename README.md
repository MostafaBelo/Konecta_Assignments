Hello shabab, sorry for sending it late but here's the task for this week:
Part 1: Load Image Data and Explore it
Here's the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification

Part 2: Model Development

- Build a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
- Use convolutional layers, pooling, and dropout.
- Experiment with different architectures (depth, filters, activation functions).
- Train your model with a training/validation split.

Part 3: Model Evaluation

- Evaluate your trained model using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score (per class, macro/micro averaging)
- Confusion Matrix (to analyze misclassifications)
  \*Provide plots for:
- Training/Validation accuracy over epochs
- Training/Validation loss over epochs

Part 4: Hyperparameter Tuning

- Experiment with at least three hyperparameters such as:
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Number of convolutional layers / filters
- Dropout rate
- Optimizer (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.)
- Compare results (tables/plots) and justify which hyperparameters worked best.

Part 5: Deliverables

- A Jupyter Notebook / Python script with:
- Code for dataset loading, preprocessing, and model training.
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations.
- Hyperparameter tuning experiments.
